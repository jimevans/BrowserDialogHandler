BrowserDialogHandler
====================

This project is for a prototype of a cross-platform dialog handling library for browsers
In theory, it would allow a user to set up handlers for all of the common types of browser-
spawned dialogs, including login dialogs, JavaScript dialogs, and file selection dialogs.
It would be ideal for use with WebDriver, but it requires the user to know the handle to
the main browser window, which WebDriver does not expose.

This is only a proof of concept, not a finished project. Furthermore, it is not likely to
receive many updates. It is provided here, as source code, so that someone more ambitious
may fork and complete.
